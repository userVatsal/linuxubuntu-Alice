Sure, here are the commands to complete the tasks in Unit 1 Workshop 1 on directories:

### Directories

1. **Find your current working directory:**
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

### Listing the Contents of a Directory

2. **List the contents of your working directory:**
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

3. **List all contents, including hidden files:**
   ```bash
   ls -a
   ```

4. **List the size of each directory or file in human-readable format:**
   ```bash
   ls -sh
   ```

5. **List the contents in long format with details:**
   ```bash
   ls -l
   ```

6. **Combine options for `ls` (e.g., long format with human-readable sizes):**
   ```bash
   ls -lh
   ```

### Changing Directory and Making New Directories

7. **Change to the `Documents` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Documents
   ```

8. **Check your current directory:**
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

9. **Create a new directory called `dir1`:**
   ```bash
   mkdir dir1
   ```

10. **Check that `dir1` has been created:**
    ```bash
    ls
    ```

11. **Move into `dir1` and create `dir2` and `dir3` inside it:**
    ```bash
    cd dir1
    mkdir dir2 dir3
    ```

12. **Check that `dir2` and `dir3` have been created:**
    ```bash
    ls
    ```

13. **Move inside `dir2` and print the working directory:**
    ```bash
    cd dir2
    pwd
    ```

14. **Move up one level to the parent directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ..
    pwd
    ```

15. **Move up another level to the `Documents` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ..
    pwd
    ```

16. **List the contents of all directories recursively:**
    ```bash
    ls -R
    ```

### Constructing Relative File Paths

17. **Move straight into `dir2` using a relative path:**
    ```bash
    cd dir1/dir2
    pwd
    ```

18. **Move straight to `dir3` using a relative path:**
    ```bash
    cd ../dir3
    pwd
    ```

19. **Move straight to the `Documents` directory by moving up two levels:**
    ```bash
    cd ../..
    pwd
    ```

20. **Move into `dir3`, create `dir4` inside it, and then move into `dir4`:**
    ```bash
    cd dir1/dir3
    mkdir dir4
    cd dir4
    pwd
    ```

21. **Move from `dir4` to `dir2` with a single command:**
    ```bash
    cd ../dir2
    pwd
    ```

22. **Move back to the last directory (`dir4`):**
    ```bash
    cd -
    pwd
    ```

23. **Return to your home directory:**
    ```bash
    cd
    ```

24. **Go straight to `dir3` from your home directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Documents/dir1/dir3
    pwd
    ```

25. **Create `dir5` and `dir6` inside `dir4` while keeping `dir3` as your working directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir dir4/dir5 dir4/dir6
    ```

26. **List the files inside `dir4` while keeping `dir3` as your working directory:**
    ```bash
    ls dir4
    ```

27. **Move up two levels to `Documents` and list the files inside `dir4`:**
    ```bash
    cd ../..
    ls dir1/dir3/dir4
    ```

### Deleting Directories

28. **Move into `dir4` and delete `dir6`:**
    ```bash
    cd dir1/dir3/dir4
    rmdir dir6
    ls
    ```

29. **Move up to `dir1` and try to delete `dir3`:**
    ```bash
    cd ..
    cd ..
    rmdir dir3
    ```

30. **Delete `dir3` using `rm -r`:**
    ```bash
    rm -r dir3
    ```

### Practice

- **Explore the file system, create and remove directories, and move between them until you feel comfortable.**
- **Make notes on todayâ€™s key points.**
- **Research other options for `ls`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, and `rm` commands and try them out.**
- **Use `--help` to find information and options for a command:**
  ```bash
  ls --help
  ```

- **Create and delete several directories in one go using `mkdir` or `rmdir`:**
  ```bash
  mkdir -p parent/child1 parent/child2
  rmdir parent/child1 parent/child2
